Revision history for Module-New

0.05 to be released
  - Test::* modules should be declared with "test_requires"
    at least when we use Module::Install (Adam Kennedy's suggestion)
  - removed auto_install from the template for Module::Install.
    It's useful for applications but it's also an unblessed
    feature, and be avoided for modules. (Adam Kennedy's suggestion)

0.04 2009/08/06
  - no new features
  - bumped up the version req of Text::MicroTemplate to 0.06.
    note that it (silently) removed a "raw_expression_mark"
    option. if your templates relied on it, please fix them.

0.03 2009/03/28
  - bumped up the version req of Log::Dump to 0.03
  - added missing "no_prompt" for a config test
    (which must be the cause of the hang)
  - removed a broken piece of a test (deprecated option)

0.02 2009/03/26
  - initial CPAN release. totally refactored.

0.01 2007/11/21
